## The Dev Process
The feed was a one week project that I decided to undertake as an exeperience to see how fast and efficiently I could bootstrap an MVP (Minimum Valuable Product).

I used the following stack in order to develop *thefeed*:

- React.js
- Reflux.js (Flux)

- Various JavaScript libraries
